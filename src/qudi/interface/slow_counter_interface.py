    A slow counter is a measuring device that measures with a precise frequency one or multiple physical quantities.

    An example is a device that counts photons in real time with a given frequency.

    The main idea of such a device is that the hardware handles the timing, and measurement of one or multiple
    time varying quantities. The logic will periodically (but with imprecise timing) poll the hardware for the new
    reading, not knowing if there is one, multiple or none.
